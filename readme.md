Open Schedule Format (OSF) is a simple schema for a JSON representation of a schedule data and information model. 
It is intended for use in interchanging or archiving a schedule model and is therefore a descriptive rather than a prescriptive format.<br>

Its part of Autodesk Flow Generative Scheduling application
Flow Generative Scheduling allows you to generate scenarios of a schedule that has been imported into Flow Generative Scheduling. 
This means that you first create a schedule elsewhere and do not 
create or edit a schedule directly in Flow Generative Scheduling.<br>
